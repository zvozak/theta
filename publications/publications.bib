    abstract  = {Formal methods have an important role in ensuring the correctness of safety critical systems. However, their application in industry is always cumbersome: the lack of experts and the complexity of formal languages prevents the efficient application of formal verification techniques. In this paper we take a step in the direction of making formal modelling simpler by introducing a framework which helps designers to construct formal models efficiently. Our formal modelling framework supports the development of traditional transition systems enriched with complex data types with type checking and type inference services, time dependent behaviour and timing parameters with relations. In addition, we introduce a toolchain to provide formal verification. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in an industrial case study.},

    abstract = {Formal verification is becoming more prevalent, especially in the development of safety-critical systems, where mathematically precise proofs are required to ensure suitability and faultlessness. However, a major drawback of formal methods is their high computational complexity. This also holds for model checking, one of the most prevalent formal verification techniques. Model checking aims to automatically verify a system by exhaustively (explicitly or symbolically) analyzing its possible behaviors. However, relatively small systems can have an unmanageably large or even infinite number of behaviors. There are several existing approaches to handle this problem, but as the complexity of the models increases, new and more efficient algorithms are required. A widely used technique to overcome the former problem is Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR). CEGAR-based approaches work on an abstraction of the model, which is computationally easier to handle. A common abstraction scheme is to over-approximate the set of behaviors by systematically relaxing constraints in the model. However, the result of the algorithm may be imprecise due to the coarseness of the abstraction. In such cases, the abstraction has to be refined. CEGAR-based approaches usually start with a coarse abstraction to minimize computational cost and apply refinement until a precise result is obtained. In my work I examine the literature and the theoretical background of model checking of transition systems using CEGAR-based approaches. I present first order and temporal logic for formalizing systems and requirements, and I analyze two CEGAR algorithms based on different subtypes of over-approximation. I also examine a handful of related techniques that can make CEGAR more efficient, including SAT/SMT solving, interpolation and lazy abstraction. I also propose a new algorithm that combines the advantages of these approaches and techniques. I have implemented these algorithms in order to evaluate and compare their performance. Analysis of the measurement results highlights the advantages and shortcomings of the algorithms for several types of models.},

    abstract = {As embedded systems are becoming more and more common in our lives, the importance of their safe and fault-free operation is becoming even more critical. Unlike testing, formal verification can not only prove the presence of errors, but their absence as well, making it suitable for verifying safety-critical systems. Formal verification may be done by transforming the already implemented source code to a formal model and querying the resulting model's properties on the reachability of an erroneous state. Sadly, source code to formal model transformations often yield unmanageably large and complex models, resulting in an extremely high computational time for the verifier. In this work I propose a complex workflow which provides a source code to formal model transformation, with program size reduction optimizations. These optimizations include constant propagation, dead branch elimination, loop unrolling, function inlining, extended with a program slicing algorithm which splits a single large problem into multiple smaller ones. At the end of the workflow, a bounded model checker and a k-induction algorithm verifies these smaller slices. Furthermore, I provide benchmarks to demonstrate the usability and efficiency of this workflow and the effect of the optimization algorithms on the formal model.},

    abstract = {Nowadays, as embedded systems take an increasingly important part in every aspect of our life, checking their correct behavior becomes more and more essential, especially in safety-critical cases, where a future of an enterprise or human lives rely on them. Formal verification is an important method, providing strong mathematical basis to check the correctness of the models in the design phase of the system’s lifecycle. Hierarchical statecharts, as a frequently used behavioral model, are one of the foundations of system design, so their verification has an increased relevance. However in many cases, even the verification of a simple statechart can be challenging, since the large state space can prevent the verification as it grows exponentially with the number of variables in the system. There are several algorithms in the literature to efficiently handle and explore the state space. One of the most common amongst them is the bounded state reachability analysis, which is often realized with logical solvers, such as SAT and SMT solvers. In order to perform the analysis, the transition relation of the statechart is transformed to logical formulas, and these formulas are fed to the solver. However, even these algorithms may not handle the complex behavior caused by the various data types and constructions used in the component models. To reduce the complexity caused by the huge state space, a possible solution is to use abstraction, even though it can fade details that are inevitable for successful verification. In these cases, the abstraction needs to be refined and the represented details should be enriched. This concept is the so-called Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR) approach. Most of the verification techniques used in practice do not exploit the information underlying in the hierarchical structure of the statecharts. The aim of my work is to develop algorithms that can handle hierarchical statecharts efficiently, and furthermore, that can benefit from the underlying information encoded in the state hierarchy during verification. I present a novel approach that can be used to effectively transform complex statecharts into logical formulas, taking benefits from the hierarchy. Improving that, I introduce an algorithm based on abstraction refinement (CEGAR), that takes hierarchy information into consideration during the refinement, and makes it possible to verify complex statecharts using logical solvers. The efficiency of the previously presented algorithms is demonstrated and compared on an industrial case study.},

    abstract = {Nowadays safety-critical systems are becoming increasingly prevalent, however, faults in their behaviour can lead to serious damage. Therefore, it is extremely important to use mathematically precise verification techniques during their development. One of them is formal verification, that is able to find design problems from early phases of the development. However, the complexity of safety-critical systems often prevents successful verification. This is particularly true for real-time systems: the set of possible states and transitions can be large or infinite, even for small timed systems. Thus, selecting appropriate modelling formalisms and efficient verification algorithms is very important. One of the most common formalisms for describing timed systems is the timed automaton that extends finite automata with clock variables to represent the elapse of time. When applying formal verification, reachability becomes an important aspect – that is, examining whether the system can reach a given erroneous state during its execution. The complexity of the problem is exponential even for simple timed automata (without discrete variables), thus it can rarely be solved for large models. A possible solution to overcome this deficiency is to use abstraction, which simplifies the problem to be solved by focusing on the relevant information. However, the main difficulty when applying abstraction-based techniques is finding the appropriate precision, which is coarse enough to reduce complexity but fine enough to be able to solve the problem. Counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) is an iterative method starting from a coarse abstraction and refining it until a sufficient precision is reached. The goal of my work is to develop efficient algorithms for the verification of timed automata. In my work I examine and develop CEGAR-based reachability algorithms applied to timed automata and I integrate them to a common framework where components of different algorithms are combined to form new and efficient verification methods. The framework offers two realizations of the CEGAR approach: one of them applies abstraction to the automaton in order to gain an overapproximation of the set of reachable states (the state space), and the other applies abstraction directly to the state space. I demonstrate the efficiency of the developed algorithms by measurements on examples that are commonly used to benchmark model checking algorithms for timed automata.},

To ensure efficiency and termination, the computed zones are generalized using maximal constants obtained from guards either by static analysis or lazily for a given path. In this paper, we propose a lazy method based on zone abstraction that, instead of the constants in guards, considers the constraints themselves. The method is a combination of forward search, backward search and interpolation over zones: if the zone abstraction is too coarse, we propagate a zone representing bad states backwards using backward search, and use interpolation to extract a relevant zone to strengthen the current abstraction. We propose two refinement strategies in this framework, and evaluate our method on the usual benchmark models for timed automata. Our experiments show that the proposed method compares favorably to known methods based on efficient lazy non-convex abstractions.},

The goal of the framework is to support the design, execution and evaluation of abstraction refinement-based reachability analysis algorithms for models of different formalisms. It enables the definition of input formalisms, abstract domains, model interpreters, and strategies for abstraction and refinement. Currently it contains front-end support for transition systems, control flow automata and timed automata. The built-in abstract domains include predicates, explicit values, zones and their combinations, along with various refinement strategies implemented for each. The configurability of the framework allows the integration of several abstraction and refinement methods, this way supporting the evaluation of their advantages and shortcomings. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework by use cases for the safety checking of PLC, hardware, C programs and timed automata models.},

Moreover, there does not exist a public set of models that can be used as an appropriate benchmark suite.

It is also possible to perform backward exploration based on zones, but calculating predecessor states for systems with data variables is computationally expensive, prohibiting the successful application of this approach so far. In this paper we overcome this limitation by combining zone-based backward exploration with the weakest precondition operation for data variables. This combination allows us to handle diagonal constraints efficiently as opposed to zone-based forward search where most approaches require additional operations to ensure correctness. We demonstrate the applicability and compare the efficiency of the algorithm to existing forward exploration approaches by measurements performed on industrial case studies. Although the large number of states often prevents successful verification, we show that data variables can be efficienlty handled by the weakest precondition operation. This way our new approach complements existing techniques.},

The proposed abstraction refinement strategy is based on interpolation for variable assignments and symbolic backward search. We combine in a single algorithm our abstraction method with known efficient lazy abstraction algorithms for the handling of clock variables.

    abstract = {Software systems are controlling devices that surround us in our everyday life. Many of these systems are safety-critical (e.g., autonomous vehicles, power plants), thus ensuring their correct operation is gaining increasing importance. Formal verification techniques can both reveal errors and give guarantees on correctness with a sound mathematical basis. One of the most widely used formal verification approaches is model checking, which systematically examines all possible states and transitions (i.e., the state space) of the software. However, a major drawback of model checking is its high computational complexity, often preventing its application on real-life software. Counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) is a supplementary technique, making model checking more efficient in practice. CEGAR works by iteratively constructing and refining abstractions in a given abstract domain. There are several existing domains, such as explicit-values, which only track a relevant subset of program variables and predicates, which use logical formulas instead of concrete values. Observations show that different abstract domains are more suitable for different kinds of software systems. Therefore, so-called product domains have also emerged that combine different domains into a single algorithm. In this work, we develop and examine various strategies to combine the explicit-value domain with predicates. Our approaches use different information from the already explored abstract state space to guide further exploration more efficiently. We implement our new strategies on top of Theta, an open source verification framework. This allows us to perform an experiment with a wide range of software systems including industrial PLC codes. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches and we also compare them to existing methods. Our experiments show that the new strategies can form efficient combinations of the existing algorithms.},

    abstract = {Software plays an ever increasing role in our lives. Nowadays, software is used even in safety critical fields where a potential failure can lead to significant consequences: software failures can cause fortunes to go to waste, airplanes to crash, or nuclear power plants to stop. Thus ensuring the correctness of such critical software is a crucial task. Verification is the process of checking that the software operates as expected. Formal methods are often used to verify critical systems, which - as opposed to traditional verification methods (such as testing) - is not only able to show the presence of errors, but also to prove their absence. One of the most widely applied formal method is model checking, which constitutes traversing the state space of the software to prove or disprove formal requirements against the system. IC3 is a state-of-the-art model checking algorithm, originally developed for checking hardware models. The unique property of IC3 is that it proves the correctness of the system in incremental steps by proving several simple lemmas about the system. If the system is correct, the proven lemmas collectively form a proof of that fact (they specify a safe overapproximation of the state space). If the system is not correct, the lemmas direct the search towards a counterexample, thereby making the traversal more efficient. The original algorithm is designed to check finite state systems, and is not effective for infinite state systems. Therefore the algorithm is still the subject of active research and has several extensions. In my thesis I examine an extension to IC3 that uses (implicit) predicate abstraction to handle infinite state spaces efficiently. This method divides the state space into a finite number of partitions with respect to a set of predicates over the system variables. The partitions form a finite abstract state space, where each state is defined by which of the predicates hold and which do not. During its run, the algorithm learns new predicates to refine its abstract image of the system, while still maintaining the coarseness of the abstraction. In order to check control flow automata which describe programs, I present a transformation that creates a symbolic transition system for a control flow automaton that behaves equivalently to the automaton. The correctness of the automaton can be checked by running the algorithm on this symbolic transition system. I implement the algorithm and the transformation as part of the open source model checking framework Theta, which allows for additional ways of extending it. Finally, I evaluate the efficiency of the various configurations of the implemented algorithm.},

    abstract = {As embedded systems are becoming more and more common in our lives, the importance of their safe and fault-free operation is becoming even more critical. Model checking can prove both the presence and absence of certain errors in software systems, making it suitable for verifying safety-critical systems. The field of model checking has made a tremendous progress in the last decades, providing a great set of fast and effective algorithms. However, despite all this, model checking is still not widely adopted in a standard development workflow due to its poor accessibility. In this work, we propose a user-friendly and efficient model checking workflow, that is able to translate C programs into the language of multiple model checking engines. The workflow uses a check instrumentation workflow to represent certain software properties as reachability problems and automatically map verification results back to the level of the original source code. In order to avoid translating from a possibly diverse set of input language dialects, we make use of the LLVM compiler infrastructure framework and its intermediate program representation. Furthermore, we shall use LLVM to extend the transformation workflow with a set of built-in and custom optimization transformations. To handle the ambiguity of memory-related language constructs, we propose a generic memory model interface that may be used to implement memory models of different strengths and trade-offs. At the end of the workflow, the resulting models may verified by our own implementation of the bounded model checking algorithm, or by using the CEGAR-based Theta model checking framework. We provide a traceability component, which is able to represent verification verdicts in a user-friendly format and also able to generate an executable mock environment that demonstrates found errors in an executable program. In addition, we provide benchmarks to demonstrate the usability of this workflow.},

    abstract = {Nowadays, different kinds of software are responsible for features in safety-critical systems, like cars, airplanes, or nuclear powerplants. Often parts of the systems that used to be mechanical or hydraulical are replaced by software-driven solutions, for example, in the steering of vehicles. These embedded software components are critical in terms of proper functioning of the system, on the one hand, however, they are quite complex on the other. It follows that certain measures have to be taken to identify and correct the faults of these systems and to prove their correctness. Testing is an efficient way of finding faults, and it is part of every major standard regulating the development of safety critical systems. However, testing alone cannot prove the absence of errors in a program. Another approach is formal verification that takes the mathematical model of a given software and gives a mathematical proof of correctness. It is a computationally intensive task, as it needs to take all the possible states of a software into account, and even the simplest of programs can have an infinite state space. During the past two decades, researchers have achieved numerous breakthroughs in the field of formal verification; however, due to the complexity of the underlying mathematical field, it is still too early for using formal verification in the industry on a daily basis. The goal of this paper is to combine these two different approaches in the AUTOSAR environment used heavily in automotive software development. In this paper, an algorithm is presented that uses the results of a verification process to generate tests while taking into account the uniqueness of AUTOSAR components. If the verification succeeds, either there is a mathematical proof of correctness about the software, or there is a counterexample that makes the error reproducible. However, when formal verification fails, tests will be generated using information extracted from the visited part of the state space of the program. In connection with this, multiple strategies are presented for test generation, that are efficient in finding different kinds of program errors. The algorithms proposed are validated with a custom implementation that is able to verify computer programs written in C, using examples from the automotive industry. },

Formal verification techniques allow rigorous reasoning about the operation of computer systems and programs. With a sound and complete mathematical basis, it is both possible to show the presence of certain kinds of errors and to prove their absence. Formal methods are often applied in critical domains (e.g. industrial controllers) to increase quality and trust in their correct operation. However, most of the interesting questions to be analyzed are computationally complex or undecidable in general. Therefore, verification approaches in different problem domains usually put more emphasis on different properties of the analysis to achieve a reasonable trade-off. Such properties include (1) expressive power (2) efficiency, and (3) the amount of conclusive answers. This work addresses challenges related to the properties mentioned above in three different problem domains using different approaches to make verification effective.
Thesis 1 targets concurrent and asynchronous systems by modeling them with Petri nets and checking the reachability of a given state. We study an existing algorithm that uses an efficient structural over-approximation. However, the expressive power is limited to simple reachability properties and the algorithm can easily give inconclusive answers due to its iteration strategy. We lift the expressive power of the algorithm by handling a generalized version of reachability and supporting Petri nets extended with inhibitor arcs. We increase the number of conclusive answers by the algorithm via a new iteration approach on invariants and a hybrid search strategy.
Thesis 2 targets embedded software code by modeling them with control-flow automata and checking the reachability of a distinguished error location. We study abstraction-refinement-based model checking where efficiency is still a significant limitation due to the complexity of the programs and the rich domains of their variables. We propose various efficient strategies for both abstraction and refinement. For abstraction, we extend the explicit-value analysis with limited successor enumeration, and we adapt structural information from the program to guide the search more efficiently. For refinement, we develop a backward-search based interpolation strategy and an approach that uses multiple counterexamples for a faster convergence to the appropriate level of abstraction.
Thesis 3 targets decentralized, blockchain-based systems by translating contracts (programs running on such systems) to an intermediate verification language. We adapt existing modular specification constructs to this context and also propose domain-specific properties. This provides a flexible and expressive approach to specify high-level, functional properties of contracts. We define a translation from contracts to the Boogie intermediate verification language, and leverage existing modular verification approaches. Furthermore, we develop a modular encoding of arithmetic that can capture operations precisely and efficiently over large bit-widths that are common in this domain.
All contributions have been implemented in practical tools and are available publicly. We also evaluate our contributions on various synthetic and real-world examples to prove their applicability. Results show that our contributions successfully address the targeted challenges and provide effective verification approaches in general.

Besides the proposed refinement strategies, the configurability of the framework allows the integration of existing efficient lazy abstraction algorithms for clock variables based on LU-bounds. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework and the proposed refinement strategies by an empirical evaluation on a wide range of timed automata models, including ones that contain discrete variables or diagonal constraints.},

    abstract = {In a model-driven development workflow, formal verification can give early feedback on the correctness of the system under development. However, formal methods face various challenges in practice. First, engineering models are typically developed in higher-level modeling languages, whereas formal methods usually operate on low-level mathematical formalisms. Second, verification algorithms are resource-intensive, especially on complex engineering models. Theta is a generic and configurable verification framework that aims to tackle these challenges by providing different low-level formalisms and efficient, abstraction-based algorithms. However, existing formalisms are either too low-level or domain-specific for model-driven development in general. In this work I propose a novel intermediate representation, the eXtended Symbolic Transition System (XSTS) formalism. The XSTS formalism offers higher-level constructs and a textual domain-specific language for easier translation from engineering models. In the meantime, it also has clear and well-defined semantics under different abstract domains, and adapts a standard interpreter interface towards existing verification algorithms. Furthermore, I developed XSTS-specific extensions and strategies that can improve the performance. My work was integrated into the Gamma Statechart Composition Framework, allowing me to perform an experimental evaluation on use cases provided by industrial partners. I evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of the different algorithm configurations and the results confirmed that the XSTS formalism is both effective and efficient.},

    abstract = {An increasing part of our lives is being automated. We solve more and more problems with software systems. We even trust software systems with tasks where their potential improper operation can have catastrophic consequences. While bugs in software that control financial systems or critical infrastructure can lead to economic damage, bugs in the software of an aeroplane or a medical device may endanger life. Ensuring that there are no bugs in the software that runs on such systems deserves special attention. Verification methods integrated into the development process support the detection of bugs and improve the quality of the software. Using traditional verification methods (such as testing), one can usually only reduce the probability of bugs being present, but they can never be completely sure that the software under test works correctly in the cases they did not try. Using Formal methods, on the other hand, one can prove some formally stated properties mathematically. One of the branches of formal methods is model checking. Model checking systems work with a formal model of the system. They traverse the state space of the model and check if the property they are trying to prove is satisfied. The family of algorithms we examine in the thesis can check software models by trying to synthesize loop invariants. These are logical formulae that form lemmas about the program. The lemmas are proven by induction, and together they prove that the model is correct. We can view the task of synthesizing invariants as a special case of solving Horn clauses. The Horn-ICE verification toolkit solves Horn clauses through the collaboration of a teacher and a learner module. The learner synthesizes invariant candidates, and the teacher checks them. If the candidates are not invariants, the teacher gives samples to the learner, which the learner can use to improve the candidates—for example with algorithms known from machine learning. In this thesis, we adapt some previously published Horn clause solver algorithms to invariant synthesis, combine them and measure the efficiency of the completed prototype. A special feature of the presented solution is that the samples that the teacher gives to the learner can represent infinitely many states of the program, as opposed to the Horn-ICE toolkit, where the samples only represent a single program state.},

    abstract = {Software systems are controlling devices that surround us in our everyday life. Many of these systems are safety-critical (e.g., autonomous vehicles, power plants), thus ensuring their correct operation is gaining increasing importance. Formal verification techniques can both reveal errors and give guarantees on correctness with a sound mathematical basis. One of the most widely used formal verification approaches is model checking, which systematically examines all possible states and transitions (i.e., the state space) of the program. However, a major drawback of model checking is its high computational complexity, often preventing its application on real-life software. Counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) is a supplementary technique, making model checking more efficient in practice. CEGAR works by iteratively constructing and refining abstractions in a given abstract domain. There are several existing domains, such as explicit-values, which only track a relevant subset of program variables and predicates, which use logical formulas instead of concrete values. Observations show that different abstract domains are more suitable for different kinds of software systems. Therefore, so-called product domains have also emerged that combine different domains into a single algorithm. In this work, we develop and examine various strategies to combine the explicitvalue domain with predicates. Our approaches use different information from the already explored abstract state space to guide further exploration more efficiently. We also formalize the proposed algorithms in a unified framework and implement our new strategies in Theta, an open source verification framework. This allows us to perform experiments with a wide range of software systems including industrial PLC codes. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches and we also compare them to existing methods. Our experiments shows that the new strategies can form efficient combinations of the existing algorithms.},

Formal verification is an approach of using mathematically precise representations and algorithms to check properties of a given program or model. Formal verification is gaining increasing importance, especially in safety-critical domains. However, formal methods are computationally complex, which has resulted in various efficient algorithms tailored for different application domains.
In most cases, choosing the right algorithm and configuration for a given problem requires expert knowledge (e.g. which abstraction method to use during the verification). Even an expert might need to execute several configurations before finding one that performs well on the given verification task. But time and resources are limited in most cases.
My goal in this work is to propose techniques that help utilize the available time more efficiently. Assuming a configurable verifier tool, an input task, a time constraint and sequential execution, the proposed methods select and dynamically change verification configurations forming a complex portfolio. The novelty of the method is that it does not only rely on information from the input task, but also tracks runtime progress information from the verifier and intervenes in the current execution by switching configurations.
To show how these techniques can be tailored to a tool in practice, I realized them in the tool Theta, focusing on C program verification. Improvements include adding a runtime enhancement to the abstraction-refinement loop of the algorithm, which is capable of detecting when the algorithm is stuck. A portfolio offering a diverse set of configurations with algorithm selection is also added, such that it complements the runtime approach to increase the chance of success.
For evaluation, a subset of the benchmarking tasks of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-COMP) is used. SV-COMP is widely regarded as a de-facto standard benchmark set of C program verification tasks. The recommended improvements were compared to several generally well-performing configurations, executed one at a time and in a naive sequential portfolio as well. The tool with the improvements proposed in this thesis proved capable of solving more tasks significantly faster than those in the baseline configurations.
To summarize, I designed approaches for efficient verification by automating some of the configuration and algorithm selection tasks requiring expert knowledge. The approaches are general and applicable in any verification framework. To evaluate them, I realized these techniques in a specific verifier framework, showing how it can improve the tool's performance.},

We trust the lives of people on the safety of computer software, and we have to be absolutely certain they will never fail. One of the problems state-of-the-art verification tools struggle with is weakly ordered models of communication, both in the case of shared memory concurrency and distributed systems. The seemingly arbitrary reordering of accesses makes the state space unmanageably large for conventional approaches. In this thesis, I survey the landscape of verification tools capable of performantly handling parallelism, both in the case of sequential consistency as well as weak memory ordering (1). I implement one of the best approaches in the verification framework Theta, a tool maintained by the Critical Systems Research Group (2). Furthermore, I propose a novel approach for handling practically infinite-state inputs for the weakly ordered memory models, and I create a proof-of-concept implementation of the main parts of the algorithm (3). Finally, I apply the memory modeling principles to message-based communication protocols, thereby widening the applicability of the algorithms and approaches shown before (4).},

Our experience suggests that well-established techniques in compiler technology are not necessarily beneficial to model checkers and sometimes can even hurt their performance. In this paper, we review the tools mature enough to participate in the Software Verification Competition in terms of the employed analysis and frontend techniques. We find that successful tools do exhibit a bias toward certain combinations. We explore the theoretical reasons and suggest an adaptable approach for model checking frameworks. We validate our recommendations by implementing a new frontend for a model checking framework and show that it indeed benefits some of the algorithms.}

    abstract = {Ensuring the correct functioning of safety critical systems is essential, as even the smallest mistakes can lead to significant material damage or - in extreme cases - cost human lives. Formal verification is capable of proving the correctness of the system and uncovering hidden faults. As opposed to testing, formal verification can give a mathematically sound proof of correctness, but its resource intensiveness hinders widespread application. Embedded developers and hardware design engineers can already make use of an extensive set of formal verification tools, but the same cannot be said about systems engineers sadly. Systems engineers typically use high-level, complex, heterogeneous models. Verifying such systems poses a different challenge than the verification of software or hardware - the representations and algorithms used for these two have been developed to solve problems of a different nature. A system model typically contains multiple heterogeneous components, which means that in order to verify the complete system, a common language is required that is a good compromise between the different paradigms. When designing such a language, there is a trade-off between generality and efficiency. How can we take advantage of as much domain specific information as possible without losing generality - and thus the ability to describe the different heterogeneous components with the same language? During my previous research I developed the Extended Symbolic Transition System (XSTS) formalism, which was the first step towards creating such a language. In this work, I present extensions and optimizations, which enabled the XSTS language and infrastructure to efficiently verify large-scale industrial models. Increasing the expressive power of the language widened the scope of verifiable high-level engineering models. By improving the product abstraction domain, I created a dedicated combined abstract domain, which is capable of efficiently tracking control and general information together. I also developed algorithmic optimizations that help make the most efficient use of the information available at a given level of abstraction, resulting in a significant simplification of the logical formulas passed to the constraint solver underlying the algorithm. In addition, I propose modeling and transformation best practices that lead to better performance in certain source models. The extensions presented in this work constitute a significant and definite step towards finding the most suitable level of abstraction for the verification of heterogeneous system models. To prove the practical applicability of my approach, I present an industrial case study created in the SysML modeling language, which became verifiable thanks to the additions made to the XSTS formalism and model checker. I evaluated my approach in an extensive benchmarking campaign, which further underlined the efficiency and necessity of the extensions presented in this work.},

    abstract = {As multi-core processors gain popularity in safety-critical systems, multi-threaded programs are increasingly used in these systems to exploit their full potential. Concurrency introduces a new level of complexity into software verification due to the great number of possible thread interleavings. Achieving satisfying test coverage is even more challenging, and naive verification techniques become practically infeasible as a result of this complexity. Partial order reduction (POR) is an effective approach to handle concurrency in model checking. Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR) is an efficient abstraction-based technique for checking reachability in a state space. Partial order reduction has been an active field of study in recent decades. Several algorithms have been published with the aim of achieving better performance by greater reduction. Some state-of-the-art partial order reduction algorithms are presented in this report. Mostly though, these algorithms only assume a simple state space exploration which limit the possibilities for further optimization. In this work, I present novel ways to integrate a dynamic partial order reduction algorithm into an abstraction-based verification process. Information is exploited about the applied abstraction when building a dependency relation on operations of a program. If the source of dependency between certain operations is abstracted away, they need not be considered dependent. By decreasing the dependency in the model, the reducing effect of partial order reduction is increased. Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR) has several optimizations including lazy computation. I show how the proposed abstraction-aware partial order reduction algorithm can be combined with the lazy computation of the state space. As an application of the presented algorithms, I introduce how partial order reduction can be used for data race detection. Finally, I evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.},

    abstract = {Software components of safety-critical systems are becoming more and more complex. Failure in a safety-critical system can lead to enormous financial loss, environmental dam- age, or even loss of life; thereby, the correctness of such systems needs to be ensured. Conventional testing can not be exhaustive in reasonable time, leaving the need to prove the safety of programs in other ways. Formal verification takes on this task by provid- ing a mathematically precise proof of correctness or refutation to the safety properties of programs, such as the reachability of an erroneous state. Formal verification works on formal models of programs, one such formalism being the Control Flow Automaton (CFA). It is a graph-like notation to represent programs, in which erroneous locations map to specific nodes that should be unreachable. Another formalism that is widely used as an intermediate language in the verification process is Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs). They can describe programs and their desired properties in a well-defined subset of first-order logic formulae on variables and uninterpreted functions. Therefore the question of correctness in this representation is embodied in the satisfiability of a query, which can be decided by SMT solvers designed to determine the satisfiability of mathematical formulae. Conventionally, one approach to deciding reachability in CFAs has been to transform the model into CHCs and utilize an SMT solver to find a satisfying model. However, this task tends to be difficult for SMT solvers due to the exponential number of possible assignments with respect to the number of variables and predicates. In contrast, in this work, I propose an approach to solving CHCs by transforming them into a CFA, which provides access to powerful abstraction-refinement-based model checking algorithms. Such algorithms employ abstraction to reduce the space of possible assignments, which could potentially lead to significant improvements in efficiency compared to traditional CHC solving techniques. I evaluate my approach both on synthetic and industrial examples.},
